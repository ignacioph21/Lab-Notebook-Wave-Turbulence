  abstract = {Using the FLUIDICS (Fluid Dynamics in Space) experiment in the International Space Station, turbulence of capillary waves at the air-water interface is experimentally investigated in weightlessness. Capillary waves are excited in a spherical container partially filled with water and undergoing sinusoidal or random oscillations. The fluctuations of the interface, recorded with two capacitive probes are analyzed by means of the frequency power spectrum of wave elevation. For high enough forcing amplitudes, we report power-law spectra with exponents close to the prediction of weak wave turbulence theory. However, in this experiment the free-surface steepness is not small compared to 1 and thus the investigated regimes correspond to strongly nonlinear wave turbulence.},

  abstract = {The last decade has seen a significant increase in the number of studies devoted to wave turbulence. Many deal with water waves, as modeling of ocean waves has historically motivated the development of weak turbulence theory, which addresses the dynamics of a random ensemble of weakly nonlinear waves in interaction. Recent advances in experiments have shown that this theoretical picture is too idealized to capture experimental observations. While gravity dominates much of the oceanic spectrum, waves observed in the laboratory are in fact gravity--capillary waves, due to the restricted size of wave basins. This richer physics induces many interleaved physical effects far beyond the theoretical framework, notably in the vicinity of the gravity--capillary crossover. These include dissipation, finite--system size effects, and finite nonlinearity effects. Simultaneous space-and-time-resolved techniques, now available, open the way for a much more advanced analysis of these effects.},

This can be related to the finite size of the container. In addition, the scaling of those spectra with the mean energy flux is found in disagreement with weak turbulence theory for both regimes.},

The related structure functions and the flatness are found to be power laws of the time scale on more than one decade. The exponents of these power laws increase nonlinearly with the order of the structure function. All these observations show the intermittent nature of the increments of the local slope in wave turbulence. We discuss the possible origin of this intermittency.},

In analogy with optical lattices used in ultra-cold atom physics, such materials can be created by a wave field capable of dynamically guiding matter into periodic spatial structures. Here we show experimentally that such structures can be realized at the macroscopic scale on a liquid surface by using rotating waves. The wave angular momentum is transferred to floating micro-particles, guiding them along closed trajectories. These orbits form stable spatially periodic patterns, the unit cells of a two-dimensional wave-based material. Such dynamic patterns, a mirror image of the concept of metamaterials, are scalable and biocompatible. They can be used in assembly applications, conversion of wave energy into mean two-dimensional flows and for organising motion of active swimmers.},

Since this conceptual breakthrough, turbulence has been studied in diverse systems and our knowledge has increased considerably through theoretical, numerical, experimental and observational advances. Eddy turbulence and wave turbulence are the two regimes we can find in nature. So far, most attention has been devoted to the former regime, eddy turbulence, which is often observed in water. However, physicists are often interested in systems for which wave turbulence is relevant. This textbook deals with wave turbulence and systems composed of a sea of weak waves interacting non-linearly. After a general introduction which includes a brief history of the field, the theory of wave turbulence is introduced rigorously for surface waves. The theory is then applied to examples in hydrodynamics, plasma physics, astrophysics and cosmology, giving the reader a modern and interdisciplinary view of the subject.},

This case is characterized by a rather high degree of nonlinearity and a complicated dispersion law. The absence of scale invariance makes this and some other problems of wave turbulence (e.g. nonlinear inertia-gravity waves) intractable by small-perturbation techniques, even in the weak-turbulence limit. The analytical solution obtained in the present work for an arbitrary degree of nonlinearity is shown to be in reasonable agreement with experimental data. The theory explains the dependence of the wave spectrum on wind input and describes the accelerated roll-off of the spectral density function in the narrow sub-range separating scale-invariant regimes of purely gravity and capillary waves, while the appropriate (long- and short-wave) limits yield power laws corresponding to the Zakharov-Filonenko and Phillips spectra.},

The equations for both models were solved using periodic grids with up to \$2048{\textasciicircum}2\$ points. In all simulations, the Froude number varies between \$0.015\$ and \$0.05\$, while the Reynolds number and level of dispersion are varied in a broader range to span different regimes. In all cases, most of the energy in the system remains in the waves, even after integrating the system for very long times. For shallow flows, non-linear waves are non-dispersive and the spectrum of potential energy is compatible with \${\textbackslash}sim k{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ scaling. For deeper (Boussinesq) flows, the non-linear dispersion relation as directly measured from the wave and frequency spectrum (calculated independently) shows signatures of dispersion, and the spectrum of potential energy is compatible with predictions of weak turbulence theory, \${\textbackslash}sim k{\textasciicircum}\{-4/3\}\$. In this latter case, the non-linear dispersion relation differs from the linear one and has two branches, which we explain with a simple qualitative argument. Finally, we study probability density functions of the surface height and find that in all cases the distributions are asymmetric. The probability density function can be approximated by a skewed normal distribution as well as by a Tayfun distribution.},

As suggested by Longuet-Higgins (1962), two trains of waves in mutually perpendicular directions were generated in a rectangular wave tank. The ratio {$\sigma$}               1               /{$\sigma$}               2               of the wave frequencies was varied (1{$\cdot$}4 {$<$} {$\sigma$}               1               /{$\sigma$}               2               {$<$} 2{$\cdot$}1). When {$\sigma$}               1               /{$\sigma$}               2               [eDot ] 1{$\cdot$}7357 it was expected that a resonant interaction would take place, generating a wave of frequency (2{$\sigma$}               1               -{$\sigma$}               2               ). The amplitude of the third wave was expected to increase almost linearly in the direction of wave propagation. The shape of the response curve as a function of {$\sigma$}               1               /{$\sigma$}               2               was also predicted.                          In the present experiments rather large wave amplitudes had to be used, and the theoretical shape of the response curve was distorted by non-linear detuning. Nevertheless the peak amplitude of the resonant wave was found to increase with distance in very nearly the manner predicted.             These experiments were carried out in 1961 but publication was deferred pending a similar but more accurate investigation by McGoldrick, Phillips, Huang \& Hodgson (1966). Much of the theoretical discussion given in the present paper is relevant to their work.},

  abstract = {We perform numerical simulations of the dynamical equations for free water surface in finite basin in presence of gravity. Wave Turbulence (WT) is a theory derived for describing statistics of weakly nonlinear waves in the infinite basin limit. Its formal applicability condition on the minimal size of the computational basin is impossible to satisfy in present numerical simulations, and the number of wave resonances is significantly depleted due to the wavenumber discreteness. The goal of this paper will be to examine which WT predictions survive in such discrete systems with depleted resonances and which properties arise specifically due to the discreteness effects. As in [1--3], our results for the wave spectrum agree with the Zakharov-Filonenko spectrum predicted within WT. We also go beyond finding the spectra and compute probability density function (PDF) of the wave amplitudes and observe an anomalously large, with respect to Gaussian, probability of strong waves which is consistent with recent theory [4, 5]. Using a simple model for quasi-resonances we predict an effect arising purely due to discreteness: existence of a threshold wave intensity above which turbulent cascade develops and proceeds to arbitrarily small scales. Numerically, we observe that the energy cascade is very ``bursty'' in time and is somewhat similar to sporadic sandpile avalanches. We explain this as a cycle: a cascade arrest due to discreteness leads to accumulation of energy near the forcing scale which, in turn, leads to widening of the nonlinear resonance and, therefore, triggering of the cascade draining the turbulence levels and returning the system to the beginning of the cycle.},

Two mutually-orthogonal primary wave trains are generated in a tank and their interaction products studied at various positions on the surface. Under suitable conditions, the growing resonant third-order interaction product is identified; its amplitude is shown to be a linear function of the interaction distance. The band-width of the response decreases with increasing distance, as is characteristic of the phenomenon of resonance. The ratio of the frequencies of the primary waves at resonance is very close to that predicted theoretically; the growth rate of the third component is close to, though about 20\% higher than, the predicted value. Conditions far from resonance are also studied; it is found that the growing tertiary wave is absent in this case.             These results offer the first unambiguous experimental demonstration of resonant wave interactions.},

It is further found that the interactions are energy-conserving to the order considered here.

As the flow velocity is increased, the nonlinear energy transfer generates fluid motion in a broad range of scales forming continuous wave number spectra of the kinetic energy. In isotropic homogeneous incompressible turbulence, energy flux is related to the third-order velocity structure function via the Kolmogorov 4/5 law. In three-dimensional turbulence, the energy is transferred from large to smaller scales in the process of the energy cascade. In two-dimensional turbulence, energy is transferred from smaller to larger scales, the inverse energy cascade. Turbulence greatly increases the rate of mixing in fluids and dispersion. Transport of matter in turbulent flows requires Lagrangian description, in which the observer follows the fluid particles wherever they move. Here, we review the approaches to turbulence description in two and three dimensions.},

  abstract = {The problem of turbulence is one of the central problems in theoretical physics. While the theory of fully developed turbulence has been widely studied, the theory of wave turbulence has been less studied, partly because it developed later. Wave turbulence takes place in physical systems of nonlinear dispersive waves. In most applications nonlinearity is small and dispersive wave interactions are weak. The weak turbulence theory is a method for a statistical description of weakly nonlinear interacting waves with random phases. It is not surprising that the theory of weak wave turbulence began to develop in connection with some problems of plasma physics as well as of wind waves. The present review is restricted to one-dimensional wave turbulence, essentially because 4ner computational grids can be used in numerical computations.},
